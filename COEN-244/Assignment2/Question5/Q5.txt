Question: We want to improve Q4 by adding a booking date, which is the date a passenger makes 
a booking. Passengers can make bookings for multiple flights.


Assume the following:
1. Each passenger has their own account with a unique ID
2. Passengers with accounts can add themselves on planned flights
3. There is a database with all the passengers as well as all the flights

Current functionnality:
Currently, we add passengers on flights. We enter the passenger ID and they get added onto the flight.
The flight then saves a copy of the passenger on its list of registered customers. 

To add: 
Each passenger will keep a copy of the flight within their class whenever they register, as well as a Date object from 
when they booked the flight. These objects will be stored in an array of pairs. This pair will contain a
flight id (string) as well as a Date object that shows the time of booking.

example:

//add in the header file for Passegner.h
class Passengers
{
    private:
        array<pair<string flight_id, Date booking_date>, 25> bookings;      //array that contains all flight id's and booking dates
        int number_of_flights;                                              //keeps track of how many flights are in bookings[]
    
    public:
        void flight_booking(string flight_id, Date booking_date);
}

// Within the passenger object, an array of pairs will keep track of flights and booking times (25 max
// flights is just a suggestion). Date booking_date should be the current date and time, while flight_id
// should be the ID of the flight the passenger just registered himself for.
